This dataset contains the data from paper:
    Velanova, K., M. E. Wheeler, and B. Luna. 'Maturational Changes in 
    Anterior Cingulate and Frontoparietal Recruitment Support the Development
    of Error Processing and Inhibitory Control.' Cerebral Cortex 18, no. 11

# Behavioral scoring: 
-1: drop              trail eye tracking was not usuable (blink, presaccade, bad tracking, etc)
 0: incorrect         only incorrect saccades
 1: correct           first saccade is correct
 2: error corrected   first saccade is an error, but a later saccade (+fix) is to the correct position

Latency (in sec) is time from start of the trial until the first saccade. error corrected is latency of the first (error) saccade.

Scoring was done manually using matlab+ilab. There is a program to score, but it was not used for the paper.

# Defacing

Defacing of high-resolution anatomical images was performed using pydeface
(https://github.com/poldracklab/pydeface)

# Derivatives

The MR Quality Control (mriqc) protocol was run on the imaging data before defacing was performed.
The outputs are placed in the derivatives folder.
